For this project, we were given an items.js file that contained item information from the popular website "Etsy".

The project was to generated the necessary functions from the items.js file to come up with a specific answer (of which was given).

We were given a mockup ![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarmenChico/FunctionalEtsy/master/mockup.jpg)
 of what the site to look like once we generated the answers and added accordingly a .css file, .js file and a complete .html file.
